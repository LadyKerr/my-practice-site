        Allow me to reintroduce myself. I invented swag. Poppin' bottles,
        puttin' supermodels in the cab. Yo, I'm makin' short term goals, when
        the weather folds. Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold.
        Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy. High stakes, I got
        more at stake than Philly. Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50.
        Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth, 'bout to call the papparazzi on
        myself. Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me. I'm outchere ballin',
        I know you see my sneaks. Look I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time
        for frontin, sensitive thugs ya'll all need hugs.

        Let me begin baby, my name is Bronsolino. Eat steaks off a cold plate.
        Stoned, listening to Coldplay. Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper.
        Every Sunday I'm in Tuesday leather. My beard look like Uday and Qusay.
        Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah. The moon's reflections off the
        lake hit me. All I see is C-notes, silk shirts at the casino. The face
        is silky like a tablecloth. My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach
        like a Chilean horse. I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and
        Grambling. I'm sitting at the outdoor desk with my pants off.
